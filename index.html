Q1. Given a string S. Write a program to find the length of the longest decreasing substring? Only a-Z and A-Z will be used.
Ex: BBAASSSRPPOGCBAAACBABA  
Ans:BBAA - 4   SSSRPPOGCBAAA - 13   CBA - 3  BA - 2

Q2. Number Reverse. Have the function NumberReverse(str), take the str parameter being passed which will be a string of numbers, and return a new string with the numbers in reverse order.
Examples
Input: "1 2 3" Output: 3 2 1
Input: "10 20 50" Output: 50 20 10

Q3, Given an array of N numbers, you have to report the Sum of bitwise AND of all possible subsets of this array.Examples:
For [1,2,3] 
All possible subsets are {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {2.3}, {1,3}, {1,2,3}Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 9
Ans: 9

Q4. You are given an array of size N containing integers. 3 indexes (i, J, k) are called good indexes if i < j < k, and arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k]. Good index (i, j, k) has a good sum which is equal to arr[k] - arr[i].
Print the minimum good sum present in the array. If there are no good indexes in the array, print -1. 
Examples: [3, 2, 1, 6, 7], Minimum 7-3 = 4

Q5. Determine the lexicographically smallest army of size N such that Bitwise AND of the whole array is A. Bitwise OR of the whole array is B, and Bitwise XOR of the whole array is C rf no such array exists then print -1 

Q6. There is a bag having a capacity of 'n' chocolates each. The choco lates are of 2 brands, one is labeled as "0" and the other as "1". 
From the bag, the pairs are to be found out such that the count of chocolate with label 1 is the same as the count of chocolate with label 0. 
Find the correct number of such subarrays. 
Constraints: 
• 1 <= n <= 1000000 • 0 <= arr[i]<= 1 

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer n. The next line contains 'n' elements representing an array. 

Output Format 
Print k - the number of sub arrays satisfying the condition. 
Sample Testcase #0 
Input 
8 11011100
Output

Q7. Alice is good friends with Samuel. It is Samuel's birthday and Alice brought a gift for him. The gift is a game called happy strings. For playing the game, Alice picks up a string and chooses a number A. Samuel has to find the maximum distance (distance is given by number of characters in between) between any 2 subsequent same characters in the string S given that a character X is said to be present at index i if it is present in any of the index from [i-A] to [i+A]
